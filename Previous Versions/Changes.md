# Details of Changes Between Different Versions of The Care Board

## Update to Version 1.5  
**Date:** August 1st, 2025

### 1. Replacement of Chord Chart with Sankey Diagram  
The original Chord Chart used to illustrate the flow of care from various provider types to recipients has been replaced with a Sankey diagram. This new visualization is designed to be more intuitive and easier to interpret, especially for users who are less familiar with circular data structures. The Sankey diagram provides a clearer view of the magnitude and directionality of caregiving flows across categories.

### 2. Addition of State-Level Data  
All indicators, including those shown in the Voronoi chart, have been updated to include state-level data. This enhancement allows users to explore variations and comparisons in caregiving dynamics at the state level, offering more detailed geographic insights.

### 3. Revisions to Wording and Labels  
To improve clarity and user experience, several labels and section titles have been revised. For example, the section previously titled *Shapes of Care* is now labeled *Care Providers*, and *Flow of Care* has been renamed *Distribution of Care*. These changes aim to make the dashboardâ€™s language more accessible and accurate.

### 4. New Provider Diversity Visualization  
A new section has been added to visualize provider diversity. This chart displays the distribution of caregiving responsibilities based on gender, race, and caregiver status, helping users understand the demographic makeup of caregiving populations and assess equity in care work.
